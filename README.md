# ExifTweaker

ExifTweaker is a small java desktop application, which can set the GPS position in the EXIF data of pictures.

# Usage

 - Open a folder using the top part of the window
 - Select the image you'd like to edit
 - Use the map to find the desired location and rightclick on it
 - Press the save button
 > If a picture already has GPS data, it'll have a green color in the filelist

 > You can choose from two map types, one hybrid (VirtualEarth) and one map (OSM)

# Planned features
 - Set other EXIF information as well
 - Set the GPS position with latitude/longitude values
 - Remove the need for commons-image
 - Other stuff

# Used libraries
 - [Apache Commons-Imaging](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-imaging/)
 - [JXMapViewer2](https://github.com/msteiger/jxmapviewer2) from @msteiger

# Other
 - This code is the first version, so a refactor will follow
